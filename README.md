## The Problem?
Social media platforms exploit user data by selling it for profit without compensating users. They also collect and use personal information without clear consent, leading to privacy violations and security risks.

## What does PRISM do?
PRISM solves this by leveraging blockchain to securely store user data, ensuring that only users have control over their information. Additionally, it eliminates unauthorized data exploitation by providing a transparent, consent-driven system where users decide how their data is used, while AI enhances personalization without compromising privacy.
